title: Android Introduction - Fragments 
tldr: "In this session, we present fragments. Students see the theory and then apply live coding the fragments to refactor the RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock app to ask the player's name using a *DialogFragment*. The challenge for the students is to use the *DialogFragment* to show the game results."
