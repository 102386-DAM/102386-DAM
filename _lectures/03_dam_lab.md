title: Design Pattern in Android (MVVM and Databindings) 
tldr: "The students need to recap the concepts learned in the past session about the observer pattern and the Model View Controller in this session. Therefore, in this session, we are introducing MVVM the software architecture pattern that overcomes all drawbacks of MVP and MVC design patterns on Android environments. MVVM treats both Activity classes and XML files as views and ViewModel classes as the business logic. This way, we will discuss how and why to use this pattern taking advantage of live data and data bindings. Students will refactor the RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock app to understand how it can be implemented."
