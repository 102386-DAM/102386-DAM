title: Design Pattern in Android (Observer, MVC and MVP) 
tldr: "The challenge for the students is to understand these bases to introduce in the next lesson the Model View ViewModel as the suggested and recommended architecture to use. In this session, we present the design pattern, and we focus on studying the observer pattern with the Model View Controller and Model View Presenter in Java. Then, we discuss their applications in Android environments."
