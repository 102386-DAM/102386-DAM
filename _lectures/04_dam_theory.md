title: Development Environment - Backend (Part I)
tldr: "The challenge for the students is to understand how we can develop backend services using DevOps to accelerate application delivery. In this session, we introduce Docker and Docker-compose to orchestrate the workflow for deploying a database service, an Nginx server for static data, one Adminer app to visualize and manage the database and a Python 3.7 (with falcon and mysqlalchemy) API deployed with gunicorn. We focus on databases and models implemented using mysqlalchemy. We use and starting kit to assist students with a rapid playground and testbench with all prepared and ready to use."
